## Agenda
- Administrivia
  - Note taker?

- [Islandora 8 IR Delta doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11Y7kGyVlrRW3uIqFPzMgQ2nj3gzB3U2FEO75X2n3bo8/edit?usp=sharing)
  - Replaces Islandora 8 IR MVP doc
  - MVP doc will still be available for historical purposes
  - Rough draft based on Bryan’s experience, in no way final
  - Fresh look at what work still needs to be done without the baggage of things I8 can already do
  - Delta = set of changes between one state and another
  - Very similar to ICG’s I7 LASIR project, but for I8 and led by the Islandora Foundation
  - Make comments! What features are missing from I8 AND the Delta doc that you need in order to consider migrating your IR to I8?
- SEO + Google Scholar
  - General
    - Notes from Monica at Google Scholar: The full setups for Google Scholar indexing are: 
      - (1) sitemap 
      - (2) citation_xx metatags 
      - (3) URL marker for distinguishing research content from other content (e.g. special collections, datasets)
  - Islandora 7
    - Wendy Shook on Middlebury’s work to fully optimize for Google Scholar indexing
  - Islandora 8
    - SEO already taken care of with default Drupal 8 modules, though they might still need a bit of configuration?
    - XML sitemaps
    - Meta tags
    - Robots.txt management
    - Google Scholar optimization still needed, and this would require some research + work
