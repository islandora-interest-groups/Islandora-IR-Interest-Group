# Notes:
- [Bibliography & Citation](https://www.drupal.org/project/bibcite)
  - Does bibcite let you generate formatted citations? q: from Slack channel
    - No one has any experience at this point, could solve issues with doi look up, 
    - Get a dropdown of kind of citation
    - UPEI looked at it, we should look at it/evaluate 
  - No reference to citations in Delta doc -- Will add to Delta doc
    - Is it an IR or Islandora general? Better to make it more generic.  
- [Islandora 8 delta document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11Y7kGyVlrRW3uIqFPzMgQ2nj3gzB3U2FEO75X2n3bo8/edit)
  - [Next Gen Report](https://donrichards.github.io/migrate_islandora_csv/institutional-repository.html)
  - Writing a report comparing Islandora to Samvera.  
    - Referenced some aspects of the bibcite module
    - Discovered 5gb limit on PDF in google scholar, GS suggests make it a ‘book’. Not necessarily good solution for researchers
  - Content moderation in [Islandora RDM User guide](https://islandora-rdm.researchspaces.ca/documentation)
    - [RDM playbook](https://github.com/roblib/rdm-playbook)
  - Don would appreciate any feedback if you have any
