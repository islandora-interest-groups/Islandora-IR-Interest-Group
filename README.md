### Duties of a meeting chair
* Create agenda for upcoming meeting (make a copy a previous meeting from the /meetings folder to use as a template)
* Post an email to the islandora Google Group/mailing list on the Monday before a meeting to remind members of the upcoming meeting and also to solicit agenda items from other members
* Start the meeting call and give an overview of the agenda
* Select a note taker (ask for volunteers, if none speak up try to nominate someone who has not chaired a meeting before)
* Introduce agenda items (attempt to keep discussions on track and timed proportionately so that all agenda items may be discussed)

### Duties of the note taker
* Keep track of important topics of discussion, which special attention to the results of questions put to the group or tasks to be done (and who has been assigned said task if applicable)
* Add notes to the meeting agenda under a section called "Notes" as soon as possible after the meeting
